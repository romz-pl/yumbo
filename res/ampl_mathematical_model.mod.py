#
# The mathematical optimisation model that generates the schedule for a set of jobs.
# Authors: Zbigniew Romanowski; PaweÅ‚ Koczyk; Jacek Pikul;
#
# Each job is defined by three integers: 
#   (1) the start of the job (i.e. the release date);
#   (2) the end of the job (i.e. the deadline);
#   (3) the duration of the job in hours;
#
# The PAYROLL constraints are defined for each defined payroll period.
# The constraint value V is the total number of working hours summed over all jobs and days in the period.
# Each payroll period is defined by four integers:
#   (1) the start of the payroll period;
#   (2) the end of the payroll period;
#   (3) the lower limit of the value V;
#   (4) the upper limit of the value V;
#
# The BOUND constraints are defined for intervals in the job.
# The bound value Q is the number of working hours per day on the specific job.
# Each constraint is defined by four integers:
#   (1) the start of the interval
#   (2) the end of the interval;
#   (3) the lower limit of the value Q;
#   (4) the upper limit of the value Q;
