Presolve eliminates 1501 constraints and 440 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 2;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
803 variables:
	86 binary variables
	717 integer variables
13 constraints, all linear; 803 nonzeros
	13 equality constraints
1 linear objective; 803 nonzeros.

presolve results:
	variables omitted:	440
	constraints omitted:	1501
	ranges relaxed:		434
	bounds improved:	1560
	nba cycles:		1
