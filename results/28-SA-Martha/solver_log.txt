Presolve eliminates 737 constraints and 10 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 2;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
476 variables:
	214 binary variables
	262 integer variables
9 constraints, all linear; 476 nonzeros
	9 equality constraints
1 linear objective; 476 nonzeros.

presolve results:
	variables omitted:	10
	constraints omitted:	737
	ranges relaxed:		278
	bounds improved:	758
	nba cycles:		1
	bound row scans:	152
