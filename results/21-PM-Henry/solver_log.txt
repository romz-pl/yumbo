Presolve eliminates 427 constraints and 13 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 2;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
248 variables, all integer
6 constraints, all linear; 248 nonzeros
	6 equality constraints
1 linear objective; 248 nonzeros.

presolve results:
	variables omitted:	13
	constraints omitted:	427
	ranges relaxed:		124
	bounds improved:	522
	nba cycles:		1
	bound row scans:	72
