Presolve eliminates 583 constraints and 14 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 2;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
383 variables, all integer
9 constraints, all linear; 383 nonzeros
	9 equality constraints
1 linear objective; 383 nonzeros.

presolve results:
	variables omitted:	14
	constraints omitted:	583
	ranges relaxed:		230
	bounds improved:	794
	nba cycles:		1
	bound row scans:	128
