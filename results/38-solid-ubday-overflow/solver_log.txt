Presolve eliminates 770 constraints and 270 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 3;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
612 variables:
	168 binary variables
	444 integer variables
473 constraints, all linear; 1432 nonzeros
	6 equality constraints
	467 inequality constraints
1 linear objective; 444 nonzeros.
