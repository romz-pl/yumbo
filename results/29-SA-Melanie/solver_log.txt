Presolve eliminates 506 constraints and 10 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 3;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
369 variables:
	155 binary variables
	214 integer variables
17 constraints, all linear; 404 nonzeros
	10 equality constraints
	7 inequality constraints
1 linear objective; 369 nonzeros.

presolve results:
	variables omitted:	10
	constraints omitted:	506
	ranges relaxed:		199
	bounds improved:	589
	nba cycles:		2
	bound row scans:	117
