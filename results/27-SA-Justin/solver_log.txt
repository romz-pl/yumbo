Presolve eliminates 243 constraints and 4 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 2;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
162 variables:
	53 binary variables
	109 integer variables
5 constraints, all linear; 162 nonzeros
	5 equality constraints
1 linear objective; 162 nonzeros.

presolve results:
