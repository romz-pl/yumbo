Presolve eliminates 1194 constraints and 20 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 2;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
924 variables:
	147 binary variables
	777 integer variables
16 constraints, all linear; 924 nonzeros
	16 equality constraints
1 linear objective; 924 nonzeros.
