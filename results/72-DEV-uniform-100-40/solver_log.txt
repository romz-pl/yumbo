Presolve eliminates 470 constraints.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 2;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
254900 variables, all integer
14200 constraints, all linear; 587330 nonzeros
	100 equality constraints
	14100 inequality constraints
1 linear objective; 254900 nonzeros.

presolve results:
	variables omitted:	0
	constraints omitted:	470
	ranges relaxed:		14480
	bounds improved:	120
	nba cycles:		1
