Presolve eliminates 702 constraints and 20 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 3;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
502 variables:
	131 binary variables
	371 integer variables
77 constraints, all linear; 909 nonzeros
	8 equality constraints
	69 inequality constraints
1 linear objective; 502 nonzeros.

presolve results:
	variables omitted:	20
	constraints omitted:	702
	ranges relaxed:		215
	bounds improved:	564
	nba cycles:		2
	bound row scans:	154
