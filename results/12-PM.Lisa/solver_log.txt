Presolve eliminates 1130 constraints and 20 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 2;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
860 variables:
	86 binary variables
	774 integer variables
12 constraints, all linear; 860 nonzeros
	12 equality constraints
1 linear objective; 860 nonzeros.

presolve results:
	variables omitted:	20
	constraints omitted:	1130
	ranges relaxed:		434
	bounds improved:	1654
	nba cycles:		1
	bound row scans:	232
