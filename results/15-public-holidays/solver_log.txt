Presolve eliminates 36 constraints and 27 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 2;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
0 variables;
0 constraints
1 linear objective; 0 nonzeros.

presolve results:
	variables omitted:	27
	constraints omitted:	36
	ranges relaxed:		0
	bounds improved:	0
	nba cycles:		1
	bound row scans:	6
	row-scan updates:	0
Solution determined by presolve;
objective objective_function = 1585.191795.
