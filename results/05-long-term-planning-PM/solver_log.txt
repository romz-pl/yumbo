Presolve eliminates 592 constraints and 139 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 2;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
278 variables, all integer
6 constraints, all linear; 278 nonzeros
	6 equality constraints
1 linear objective; 278 nonzeros.

presolve results:
	variables omitted:	139
