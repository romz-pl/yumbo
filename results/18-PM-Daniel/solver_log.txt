Presolve eliminates 1339 constraints and 30 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 2;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
948 variables:
	54 binary variables
	894 integer variables
13 constraints, all linear; 948 nonzeros
	13 equality constraints
1 linear objective; 948 nonzeros.
