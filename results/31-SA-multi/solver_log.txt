Presolve eliminates 6294 constraints and 172 variables.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 2;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
4364 variables:
	2797 binary variables
	1567 integer variables
77 constraints, all linear; 4364 nonzeros
	77 equality constraints
1 linear objective; 4364 nonzeros.
