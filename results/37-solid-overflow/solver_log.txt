Presolve eliminates 1001 constraints.
"option presolve 10;" used, but "option presolve 2;" would suffice.
Adjusted problem:
1007 variables, all integer
6 constraints, all linear; 1007 nonzeros
	6 equality constraints
1 linear objective; 1007 nonzeros.

presolve results:
	variables omitted:	0
	constraints omitted:	1001
	ranges relaxed:		0
	bounds improved:	0
