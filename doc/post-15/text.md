# ðŸ“… Yumbo. Expert Availability and Preferences


In complex scheduling environments where experts are assigned to multiple tasks, managing their availability is a critical factor in achieving realistic schedules. The Yumbo scheduling tool addresses this challenge by incorporating **EBDAY constraints**, an essential input parameter that defines expert availability on a daily basis.

By default, Yumbo assumes a standard workday of **8 hours per day**. However, real-world scenarios often involve deviations from this assumption:
- Experts may be **unavailable** due to vacations, holidays, or personal reasons.
- Experts may have **partial availability**, working less than 8 hours per day due to training, part-time employment, or unforeseen commitments.

The EBDAY constraint allows organizations to **effectively model these variations**. Defined in Yumbo's Excel input file, this constraint specifies expert availability per day within a given date range. Because the granularity of the EBDAY constraint is as small as a quarter of an hour, it provides a high level of flexibility without adding unnecessary complexity.



## How does this affect scheduling?
- **Realistic resource allocation:** EBDAY integration ensures that only available experts are assigned to tasks, reducing scheduling inaccuracies.
- **Dynamic Adjustments:** As time passes and the business evolves, regularly updating the schedule with new EBDAY values allows for seamless adaptation to changes in expert availability.
- **Proactive Risk Management:** Yumbo flags potential **task overflows** - instances where an assigned expert does not have enough hours to complete a task. This feature provides insight into the need for additional resources to ensure timely project completion.



ðŸ’¡ Yumbo's scheduling process is designed for **speed and adaptability**. Because the time it takes to create a new schedule is short, it is a good idea to update your availability constraints frequently. This practice helps companies to incorporate the latest availability of experts and to maintain realistic schedules that are free of conflicts.


ðŸ”— For those looking to improve the operational efficiency of staff scheduling, Yumbo is available as **open source** software on GitHub https://github.com/romz-pl/yumbo/ and as a **SaaS solution** via the Streamlit Community Cloud https://yumbo-ampl.streamlit.app/ .
