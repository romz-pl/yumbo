# Diversity of Mathematical Programming Languages

Mathematical programming languages play a central role in the world of efficient decision making, providing specialised environments for effectively modelling, analysing and solving **optimisation problems**. AMPL (A Mathematical Programming Language) is my favourite mathematical language. I like it because it provides a high-level platform for describing and solving optimisation problems. It also has a clean design and separates the mathematical modelling from the data. On the NEOS server, **about 80%** of the jobs submitted are in AMPL. However, AMPL is not the only language available for building mathematical models.


Hereâ€™s a look at some of the key players in this domain:

+ [**AMPL (A Mathematical Programming Language)**](https://ampl.com/)
A high-level modeling language enabling concise, solver-independent optimization problem descriptions, supporting linear, nonlinear, and integer programming across various industries.

+ [**GAMS (General Algebraic Modeling System)**](https://www.gams.com/)
Tailored for large-scale modeling, GAMS offers modular flexibility and solver independence, ideal for complex optimization tasks in energy, logistics, and economics.

+ [**MathProg**](https://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/MathProg.htm)
A subset of AMPL, it provides a simple, open-source platform for small-to-medium linear programming problems, often used with GLPK.

+ [**MPS (Mathematical Programming System)**](https://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/mps-format.htm)
A standardized format for optimization problems, ensuring compatibility with solvers but less intuitive for direct problem formulation.

+ [**ZIMPL (Zuse Institute Mathematical Programming Language)**](https://zimpl.zib.de/)
A lightweight language for formulating linear and mixed-integer programming models, designed for integration with commercial solvers.

+ [**FICO Xpress Mosel (Modeling, Optimization, and Simulation Environment Language)**](https://community.fico.com/s/fico-xpress-mosel-mathematical)
Part of the FICO Xpress suite, Mosel enables advanced optimization and simulation for enterprise-level applications.


Each of these languages excels in **specific scenarios**, enabling optimization professionals to tailor their tools to the problem at hand. As industries continue to embrace optimization-driven strategies, mastering these languages can be a game-changer for professionals and businesses alike.
