# ðŸ“… Yumbo. Significance of Advanced Reporting


In today's business environment, a clear, structured and visually appealing **reporting system** is no longer a luxury, but a necessity. That is why we decided to implement the advanced reporting module in Yumbo.

Yumbo's reporting module has gone through an **impressive evolution** to meet the growing needs of its users. It started with a simple text-based prototype, but as the complexity of constraints and schedules grew, it became clear that a more interactive and visual solution was needed. This led to the adoption of Streamlit as the core framework, enabling a seamless and dynamic web-based reporting system.


## What distinguishes Yumbo's reporting module?

**Modular framework**
Yumbo's reporting module is divided into intuitive sections. This allows users to quickly navigate and interpret key information.

**Excel-based input**
Instead of rigid input formats, Yumbo uses Microsoft Excel. This provides extensive editing capabilities and data validation.

**Pandas and NumPy**
Through the integration of Pandas and NumPy, the system is able to efficiently process large data sets in fractions of a second.

**Professional-quality charts**
To transform raw data into high-quality visual reports, the module uses Matplotlib, allowing users to create custom charts and plots tailored to their needs.

**High performance**
The use of caching and optimized image compression makes the reporting experience smoother, faster, and more user-friendly.


ðŸ’¡ The result? A powerful, streamlined reporting system that allows users to create a wide variety of schedules that meet the expectations of professionals.

ðŸ”— Yumbo is available as an open-source tool on [GitHub](https://github.com/romz-pl/yumbo/) and on the [Streamlit Comunity Cloud](https://yumbo-ampl.streamlit.app/).
