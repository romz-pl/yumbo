The project's primary objective is the development of a software solution that will facilitate the optimal generation of daily schedules. This software is intended to address the challenge faced by project managers, solution architects, and other professionals who are engaged in multiple tasks or projects concurrently, thereby enabling them to more efficiently manage their time and resources.


## :green[Assumptions]
It is assumed that each task is defined by its start date and end date, and that the expert is required to complete the fixed number of working hours during the lifetime of the task. It is also assumed that tasks can overlap and that the start and end dates of tasks are independent of each other. The lifetime of a task in the use cases studied so far was typically about 200 business days. Note, however, that the software does not impose any restrictions on the duration of a task.


## :green[Objectives]
The project has two objectives. Firstly, it is necessary to verify that the schedule is in compliance with the constraints of the business rules. In this regard, the following business rules must be taken into account: the permitted number of working hours per day, the availability of experts, and the holidays of experts and public holidays. Secondly, once the existence of the schedule has been checked, the daily schedule must be generated. It is assumed that the smallest working time unit is one quarter hour. This assumption is made in the understanding that during a standard working day, an expert's engagement with tasks is constrained to a maximum of 32 tasks, with each task requiring a duration of precisely one quarter hour.


## :green[Planning horizon]
The software facilitates both short-term and long-term planning. The utilisation of this software guarantees that the expert is equipped with adequate resources to address the long-term requirements of each task. In addition, the software facilitates short-term planning and scheduling, thereby enhancing the convenience of the expert. The schedule can be updated in the event of changes to the expert's availability or the addition of a new task to the task pool. 


## :green[Mathematical model]
The aforementioned problem is resolved by a mathematical model based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming, implemented in AMPL language and solved by HiGHS, a high-performance software for linear optimisation.


## :green[Formulation of the mathematical model]
The following definition of a solved problem is provided. A set of tasks is defined, with each task characterised by three properties: (a) the start date; (b) the end date; (c) the work expressed in hours. Each task in the set is assigned to at least one expert, and an expert can be assigned to one or more tasks. Consequently, there is a many-to-many relationship between tasks and experts. Constraints are further categorised into four classes, each of which is optional. The objective is to determine the expert's daily schedule that satisfies the following constraints:
- The number of hours worked per day must not exceed the limit.
- For each call period, the total number of hours worked must be within the limit.
- For each day, for each task, the number of hours worked per day must be within the limit.
- For an expert, the number of hours worked per day must be within the limit for each day.


## :green[Implementation details]
1. The problem is formulated as a linear mixed-integer problem with an objective function that favours early task completion.
2. The solution to the problem is a daily work schedule that specifies the number of hours to be worked on the task for each day.
3. The mathematical problem is implemented as a [AMPL](https://ampl.com/) program and solved by [HiGHS](https://highs.dev/) solver.
4. The graphical user interface is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/) within the [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) framework.
5. The plots are generated using the [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) library, and the data is processed using the [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) Python libraries.
