# ðŸ“… Yumbo. Expert's satisfaction with workload


In the problem of scheduling, balancing workload expectations with business constraints is a challenge. Experts are highly flexible professionals who expect not only a high hourly rate, but also a satisfactory number of hours worked per **billing period**. This is where Yumbo, an advanced scheduling tool, plays a critical role.

One of Yumbo's key features is PBSUM constraints, which act as input parameters to ensure **workload consistency** across billing periods.


## What are PBSUM constraints?
PBSUM constraints define the lower and upper limits for an expert's total working hours within a billing period - typically 20 business days. 
These constraints allow for:
- **Ensuring minimum workload** â€“ By setting a lower limit, experts are guaranteed a satisfactory number of working hours.
- **Managing work-life balance** â€“ The upper limit helps control workload distribution, especially for part-time or restricted schedules.
- **Flexible work arrangements** â€“ While full-time experts may not need an upper limit (typically 160 hours per period based on 8-hour days), PBSUM constraints enable configurations that allow for longer days or reduced schedules.



ðŸ’¡ By incorporating PBSUM constraints, Yumbo ensures that schedules are optimized for both business efficiency and **expert satisfaction**. If no feasible schedule meets these constraints, Yumbo flags it as infeasible and prompts adjustments.


ðŸ”— For those seeking smarter scheduling solutions, Yumbo is available both as an open-source tool on [GitHub](https://github.com/romz-pl/yumbo/) and as a SaaS solution via [Streamlit Comunity Cloud](https://yumbo-ampl.streamlit.app/) .
